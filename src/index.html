            <h3>Turning DNA into clear stories about your ancestry, health risks, and family future</h3>
            <p>At GENOTISM, we believe genetics should empower, not overwhelm. Our services help you explore your ancestry,
                understand carrier status for inherited conditions, and access guidance for family planning - all in plain 
                language and with your privacy protected. Every report is paired with optional genetic counseling, so you 
                can make informed choices with confidence.

                <h3>What makes GENOTISM different from other DNA services?</h3>
                <p>We focus on clarity, ethics, and privacy. At GENOTISM, every report is written in plain, everyday language so you do not 
                    get lost in complex science. To support you further, we offer the option to connect with a certified genetic counselor 
                    who can walk through your results and answer questions about your ancestry or health insights. Behind the scenes, we 
                    follow strict privacy rules — your DNA data is encrypted, handled only by trusted lab partners, and never sold to advertisers 
                    or third parties. Above all, you remain in full control: you decide if your data is used for research, you can request deletion 
                    at any time, and your information always belongs to you.</p>

                <h3>What are “DNA Insights” and how do they work?</h3>
                <p>DNA Insights are designed to make complex science easy to understand. Instead of giving you long lists of raw data or technical 
                    terms, we translate your genetic information into clear stories about where your ancestors may have lived, what unique traits 
                    you might carry, and whether you hold markers that could influence health or family planning. Each insight is paired with context 
                    — explaining what the numbers mean, how reliable the estimates are, and why they matter. The goal is not just to hand you data, 
                    but to connect genetics with your everyday life in a way that feels meaningful, responsible, and easy to share with loved ones.</p>

                <h3>Why are Health screenings important?</h3>
                <video src="assets/gif-dna.mp4" controls preload="metadata" style="width:100%;height:auto;margin:0.5rem 0;"></video>
                <p>Health screenings are important because our DNA, which carries all the instructions for our body, can sometimes change through 
                    small errors when cells copy themselves. These “replication errors” usually get repaired, but occasionally they stay, and if 
                    passed down they may increase the chance of certain inherited diseases. By looking at your genes through a screening, 
                    scientists can spot markers that suggest higher risks long before symptoms appear. This gives people and families time to 
                    make informed lifestyle, medical, or family-planning choices. In short, screenings turn hidden genetic information into 
                    practical foresight for healthier lives.</p>

                <h2>Can GENOTISM's research help society beyond individual reports?</h2>
                <p>Yes. With customer consent, GENOTISM uses only de-identified data to contribute to broader scientific knowledge. This means 
                    your personal details are removed, and what remains is anonymous information that researchers can use to study human history, 
                    genetic diversity, and patterns that may affect public health. For example, large datasets can help scientists trace ancient 
                    migrations, understand why certain conditions are more common in specific regions, or develop new approaches to preventive 
                    medicine. By choosing to share, you play a small but meaningful role in moving science forward — all while knowing that your 
                    privacy and security remain fully protected at every step.</p>
